This is an indent file for LaTeX.

It emulates Emacs' way of indenting item-environments, i.e., continuation lines of '\item', '\item[]', and '\bibitem' will be indented separately.

NOTE: I searched for an indent file for TeX and didn't found one -- so I wrote this script. Right now I've noticed that Johannes Zellner has already created an indent file for TeX (you can find his version at http://www.zellner.org/vim/indent/tex.vim). I think that's the official version.
Nevertheless, since his version doesn't indent \items the way I want them to be, I decided to release my version, too. Try both of them, use the one you like most.
